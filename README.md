# Scottish Open Data List

Last updated 19 Feb 2019

## News
The main channges to highlight are: 
- Dumfries and Galloway have launched [their portal](https://usmart.io/#/org/dumgal/) with 33 Data sets, and have overtaken most Scottish Cities on one leap.
- The [Spatial Hub](http://www.spatialhub.scot/get-data/) now have four sets of open data including Council Boundaries which is welcome. But it does have the most annoying, repetitive, and redundant pop-up known to man! 
- The [KnowFife](https://knowfife.fife.gov.uk/) statistical website is growing, but the licensing needs to be much clearer for individual data sets. 
- Clackmananshire's CKAN instance which oddly [lives under a GIS subdomain of another domain](http://gis.clacksweb.org.uk), is no longer refrenced from their main website, making it almost impossible to find.


## The Data

A list of open data resources in the Scottish public sector. 

Data is broken into two types - open data, and linked open data.

| Key     | Definition |
| :------ |:-----------| 
|A|API|
|L|Linked Open Data|
|O|Open Data|

## Local Authorities
Data provided by the 32 Local Authorities. The data provision falls into three formats: portal, landing page and GIS-only data. 

### Open Data Portals

The following councils have open data portals - most, if not all, CKAN.

### Using GIS only

These councils only expose geographical open data using their GIS systems.

The sections below list open data provision by the Scottish Government and its agencies. Locating data is not helped by the antiquated Scottish Government website. Searching tends to throw up policy pages rather than data. Thankfully they are testing a beta version website. While that looks much better it breaks many of the links.
