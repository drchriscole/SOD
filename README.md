# Scottish Open Data List

## Introduction
In February 2019 I carried out the first full analysis of public sector open data publishing in Scotland. It [didn't paint a pretty picture](https://codethecity.org/2019/11/15/scotlands-open-data-february-2019-an-update/). The data to support that piece is now in [this file](README_2019.md). 

For readability, I've split the Feb 2020 data write-ups (currently a work in progress) into individual files as you will see below. 

A blog post summarising this will be published soon. 

------

## Local Authorities
The data for Local Authorities is now located on [this page](Local_authorities.md).

### Headlines 2020
Sadly, despite 12 months passing, there has been little change in a year. One expensive portal has been scrapped without ever generating any open data (Highland) but there is one decent entry into OD publishing for the newcomers, Renfrewshire.

## Scottish Parliament
The data for Scottish Parliament is now located on [this page](Scottish_Parliament.md).

### Headlines 2020
No new datasets. About of a third of the datasets don't work at all. The confusing licensing arrangements have not been resolved. There are APIs which are worth a look at, but not all work. Two thirds of the data sets appear to have new data in the intervening year.

## Health

## Scottish Universities and Colleges
This review is to be found on [this page](FE.md)

### Headlines 2020
There is no significant change across the sector. The vast majority of institions have no provision of open data. Some have vague plans, many of them historical and not acted on. Lumping Universities and Colleges together, one might expect properly structured, and licenced opn data on:

* courses
* modules
* events
* performance (perhaps some of this is on HESA and SFC sites?)
* physical assets 
* environmental performance
* KPI targets and achievements etc.

But I could identify none of that. Overall, this was very disappointing.
