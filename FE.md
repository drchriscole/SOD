# Scottish Universities and Colleges
This page will be updated as the content is reviewed.

## News
Review underway February 2020. First draft of Universities completed. Not done FE colleges yet. 

The [Higher Education Statistics Agency](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis) publishes a range of potentially useful-looking Open Data under a [CC-BY-4.0 licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). This is data about insitutions, course, students etc - and not data published by the institutions themselves. 

Below is a list of the fifteen Universities in Scotland.

Last year I identified the open data published by two universities (__*__). These were created _for_ a specific business, research or educational purpose. The Edinburgh Data Share repository _appears_ to have increased by over 800 datasets since last year, whereas the UBDC Open Data Catalogue seems to have grown by 5 datasets.

__Abertay__ in a [rather confusing page](https://www.abertay.ac.uk/about/the-university/governance-and-management/freedom-of-information/819-open-data/) notes that "Universities are therefore not generally required, under current information legislation, to participate in the Government's Open Data initiative." It does link via several hops to what it says is open data (above) but is on a webpage with a universal "Copyright 2020 Elsevier BV" footer. Similarly it links via intermediate pages to the [UniStats website](https://unistats.direct.gov.uk/) which refused to load for me on the first day I looked at it. A day later, and it was back online. There apperared no way to find out what data it had, for example on Abertay, nor to download it as data, and, of course, no open licence for re-use although it was possible to request to re-use certain bits of data. __Herriot-Watt Uni__ had almost exactly the same page pointing to the same web pages off site. 

__Aberdeen University__ has a page [Open Data At The University of Aberdeen](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/library/support/open-data-at-the-university-of-aberdeen-636.php_). But this is a policy doc not a list of data published. Pages such as these are frustrating as they lack any dates of publication or updating, so one can't tell if this was introduced since the last review. 

__Queen Margaret University__ have a [eData](https://eresearch.qmu.ac.uk/handle/20.500.12289/8901) repository but the site is silent on the licensing of the data and any attempts to download any of the data to assess it (eg [this](https://eresearch.qmu.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/20.500.12289/9196/1%20file%2c%20594%20MB?sequence=1&isAllowed=y ) failed with a single page listing the number of files and byte size but no way to access the data. 

In searching for any open data published by the __Robert Gordon University__, I came across [this gem](https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&context=ukais2014) from 2014. I had been interviewed in 2013 and was quoted as "E-Government Manager, Organisation A":

> E-Government Manager, Organisation A mentioned that “...there isn’t a cohesive approach from the Scottish Government at the moment and other councils” and that statement is also supported by the Web Manager of Organisation B who said “Scotland is a bit behind whereas you can in England, you have a central government and character approach to publish finances and they have to do that, there is no choice”. 

Not much has changed in 7 years! 

__St Andrews University__ has [some guidance](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/research/digitalresearch/researchdata/publisharchiveandpreserve/howtopublishdata/) on how to publish research data openly, but no sign of any data published about the operation of the University iteself. 

__Stirling University__, in a similar way to Abertay and QMU, a [page](https://www.stir.ac.uk/about/professional-services/student-academic-and-corporate-services/policy-and-planning/legal-compliance/publicationscheme/8-19-open-data/) on open data as part of its Publication Scheme. It lists some seven platforms on which researchers have published data. It also point to [HESA](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/), [UniStats](https://unistats.ac.uk/), and [SFC](http://www.sfc.ac.uk/publications-statistics/statistics/statistics.aspx) for statistical data on students. 

On searching for the __University Of West of Scotland__'s open data, I was reminded of the Crighton Institute's Regional Observatory which was announced to loud [fanfares](https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/archiveofnews/2013/march/headline_269859_en.html) in 2013 and appears to have quietly been shut down in 2017. Two of the team involved say in their Linked In profiles that they left at the end of the project. Even the domain name to which articles point is now up for grabs. *How much was spent on the project, where is the data that it amassed preserved and where is the knowledge and learning arising from the project published for posterity?*

What jumps out from this is _where is the data about the day to day operation of each institution?_ 

One might expect data on:
* courses
* modules
* events
* performance (perhaps some of this is on HESA?)
* physical assets 
* environmental performance
* KPI targets and achievements etc.

But I could identify none of that.
